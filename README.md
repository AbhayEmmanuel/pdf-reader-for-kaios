## Something about Easy Read
You can also Press 5 instead of Enter key while selecting PDF file to open PDF as Easy Read (Experimental)
### But still note 
* PDFs are meant to display content as it was
* Easy read works well if pdf is simple and not have too much styling(like: color, underline, boldness, etc...)
* If PDF have any images it will not display (only texts)
