## Something about Easy Read
You can also Press 5 instead of Enter key while selecting PDF file to open PDF as Easy Read

### But note that 
PDFs are meant for displaying content as it was, Easy read works if pdf is simple and not have too much styling (like: color, underline, boldness, etc.) otherwise garbled text
